*  The Space Design Tool or SDT software suite is based on the Space      *
*  Trajectory Analysis or STA tool.  It was conceived as a research tool  *
*  to support the analysis phase of a space mission having the ability    *
*  to analyze, determine, simulate, and visualize a wide range of space   *
*  trajectories.                                                          *
*  SDT will at first update the code base and then extend the current     *
*  functionality of STA. The original STA aims of promoting  the exchange *
*  of technical ideas, and raising knowledge and competence in the areas  *
*  of applied mathematics, space engineering, and informatics will        *
*  continue.                                                              *

Libraries and data used
-----------------------

# This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
# STA uses the Eigen libraries. Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra that includes vectors, matrices, and related algorithms. 
# STA is compatible with the NASA SPICE system for spacecraft and planetary information. SPICE was developed by Caltech/JPL under contract to NASA.
# The star database (stars.dat) is derived from the ESA's HIPPARCOS star catalogue (http://www.esa.int).
# STA uses VESTA code and VESTA data. In particular, STA uses VESTA's rendering engine for the 3D view window, some its catalogs of stellar and planetary information, and some of its texture maps and 3D models of solar system bodies. VESAT is copyright of ASTOS Solutions GmbH (http://www.astos.de/products/vesta).
# STA uses Curveplot. Curveplot is a library for high precision plotting of piecewise cubic curves in OpenGL. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser Public License and is Copyright of Chris Laurel.
# STA uses OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library GLEW. For credits and authorship of this library, please read the README file inside the GLEW folder.
# STA uses the QwPlot3D programming library that provides 3D-widgets for plotting. The library is zlib licensed. QwPlot3D is copyright of Michael Bieber
# STA uses the optimizer NSGA-II from the Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (KanGAL) of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. NSGA-II is copyright of Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb.
# STA uses an adapted version of the source code of Qtiplot. QtiPlot is a computer program to analyze and visualize scientific data. The primary developer of the software package is Ion Vasilief, a freelance developer (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QtiPlot).
# STA uses Qwt library. The Qwt library contains GUI Components and utility classes which are primarily useful for programs with a technical background. Beside a 2D plot widget it provides scales, sliders, dials, compasses, thermometers, wheels and knobs to control or display values, arrays, or ranges of type double. The authors are Uwe Rathmann and Josef Wilgen (http://qwt.sourceforge.net/).
