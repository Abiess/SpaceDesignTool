*  The “Space Trajectory Analysis” or STA software suite is conceived as  *
*  a research tool to support the analysis phase of a space mission       *
*  having the ability to analyze, determine, simulate, and visualize      *
*  a wide range of space trajectories.                                    *
*                                                                         *
*  One of the STA aims is to promote the exchange of technical ideas,     *
*  and raise knowledge and competence in the areas of applied             *
*  mathematics, space engineering, and informatics.                       *

Libraries and data used
-----------------------

# This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group.
# STA uses the Eigen libraries. Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra that includes vectors, matrices, and related algorithms. 
# STA is compatible with the NASA SPICE system for spacecraft and planetary information. SPICE was developed by Caltech/JPL under contract to NASA.
# The star database (stars.dat) is derived from the ESA's HIPPARCOS star catalogue.
# STA uses Celestia code and Celestia data. In particular, STA uses Celestia's rendering engine for the 3D view window, some its catalogs of stellar and planetary information, and some of its texture maps and 3D models of solar system bodies. For credits and authorship of these parts, please read the README, AUTHORS, and LICENSE files inside the celestia-src folder.
# STA uses Curveplot. Curveplot is a library for high precision plotting of piecewise cubic curves in OpenGL. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser Public License and is Copyright of Chris Laurel.
# STA uses OpenGL Extension Wrangler Library GLEW. For credits and authorship of this library, please read the README file inside the GLEW folder.
# STA uses the QwPlot3D rogramming library that provides 3D-widgets for plotting. The library is zlib licensed. QwPlot3D ic copyright of Michael Bieber
# STA uses the optimizer NSGA-II from the Kanpur Genetic Algorithms Laboratory (KanGAL) of the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. NSGA-II ic copyright of Prof. Kalyanmoy Deb.
