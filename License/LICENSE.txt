The EUPL is the first European Free/Open Source Software (F/OSS) licence. It has been created on the initiative of the European Commission. It has been approved by the European Commission in 22 linguistic versions and can be used by anyone for software distribution. The EUPL was approved as a Licence to be used for the distribution of software developed in the framework of the IDA and IDABC programmes. Nevertheless, the text of the Licence is drafted in general terms, so the Licence may be used for other software applications, as the case may be, by other European Institutions, by national, regional or local administrations, other public entities as well as private entities and natural persons.
